In this example, the /protected endpoint requires authentication using the authenticationMiddleware. The /employees/:id endpoint doesn't use the authentication middleware, so it's publicly accessible. When a request is made to the /employees/:id endpoint, it calls the getEmployeeByID function, which retrieves the employee details from a mocked database (the employees slice in this case).

You can replace the employees slice and the getEmployeeByID function with actual database interactions, such as using an SQL or NoSQL database to store and retrieve employee data.

To test this web service, you can run the code and make requests to the /protected and /employees/:id endpoints. The /protected endpoint requires the correct x-api-key header value, while the /employees/:id endpoint can be accessed without authentication.
