Cards :

functions in the application:

newDeck --> create a list of playing cards. Essentially an array of string 
print --> Log out the contents of a deck of cards 
shuffle --> Shuffles all the cards in a deck
deal --> Create a "hand" of cards 
saveToFile --> save a list of cards to a file on a local machine 
newDeckFromFile --> Load a list of cards from the local machine 


type deck []string --> Tell go we want to create an array of strings and add a bunch of functions specifically made 
to work with it

Functions with 'deck' as a receiver --> A function with a 
receiver is like a "method" - a function that belongs to an "instance"
